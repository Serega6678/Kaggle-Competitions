Results:

1. Sqaure_Analysis.ipynb - full_sq, life_sq and kitch_sq NANs are filled in, incorrect data becomes more sensible after pipeline processing.

2. Secondary_Features_Analysis - build_year, floor, max_floor, num_room were filled; all features, coresponding to distance to smth are proved to be correct (judging by geolocation & mean value among the sub area)
